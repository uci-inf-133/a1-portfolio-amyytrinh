--Readme document for Amy Trinh, trinha11@uci.edu--

A reminder on academic integrity, as described in the syllabus.

In general, the course staff expects that you will look at code and examples from many online resources as part of the assignments, particularly to resolve syntax and understand frameworks. We expect that you'll use other libraries you find, and will even require it in some assignments. These practices are often critical to the work of developers today. The best developers are adept at interpreting the examples they see, customizing them to their specific situation, and citing their sources so they can find them later. We expect you to do the same.

While learning from examples is encouraged, attempting to pass an existing project or example from the web as your own is not allowed. If you ever have a question about what is or is not appropriate, feel free to ask the course staff!

Talking to classmates about class material, assignment requirements, etc. is a great way to verify ideas and get feedback. But this distinctly does *not* permit attempting to pass off someone else’s code as your own. Talking over ideas and approaches is allowed, but the work that you produce and submit must be your own.

1. How many assignment points do you believe you completed (replace the *'s with your numbers)?

10/10
- 1/1 Readme
- 2/2 Basic HTML content
- 1/1 Basic CSS styling
- 1/1 Advanced feature
- 2/2 Responsive layout
- 1/1 Passes validation checks
- 2/2 Embraces spirit of the assignment

2. What (a) basic features, (b) CSS features, and (c) advanced features did you include in your portfolio?

(a) Basic features
1. An image with its descriptive alt atrribute.
2. Links to external pages (linkedin, instagram).
3. footer HTML tag.
4. custom icon from Font Awesome.

(b) CSS features
1. Modifying text colors.
2. Adding custom Google fonts.
3. Use of Bootstrap CSS helpers for text and image layout.

(c) Advanced features
1. Navigation bar.
3. Contact form.


3. Did you ignore any of the warnings or errors presented by the accessibility checker? If so, why does this not seem like an accessibility concern? If it's useful, you can consolidate your thoughts on multiple warnings/errors if the rationale is similar.
- In the about.html file, there is a warning in line 38 that "Text run starts with a composing character." This warning was ignored because the text consists of decorative characters for stylistic choice that can be rendered by modern browsers.


4. How long, in hours, did it take you to complete this assignment?
- 6


5. What online resources did you consult when completing this assignment? (list specific URLs, describe queries to Generative AI, or use of AI-based code completion)
- https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.0/components/alerts/
- Generative AI was used to guide me step-by-step in building a website, including HTML structure, Bootstrap layout, and background images. It was especially used for leveraging the available information on the Bootstrap webpage and applying it to the contact form. The generated code was looked over and modified accordingly.


6. What classmates or other individuals did you consult as part of this assignment? What did you discuss?
- N/A


7. Is there anything special we need to know in order to run your code?
- N/A
